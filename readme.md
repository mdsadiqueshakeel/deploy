# User Service - MLM System

This service is part of the **MLM-System** backend. It handles user authentication, registration, profile management, password reset, referral logic, user placement (how users are connected in the referral/binary tree), and admin operations. It is designed to be accessed via the API Gateway and communicates with a MongoDB database.

## 🚦 Main Functionality

- **User Registration & Login:**  
  Handles new user sign-up, login, and JWT issuance.
- **Profile Management:**  
  Fetch and update user profile, including personal and bank details.
- **Password Management:**  
  Forgot password (email reset link), reset password, and change password.
- **Referral System:**  
  Supports direct and binary tree referral logic, referral code validation.
- **User Placement (Referral/Binary Tree):**  
  When a user registers with a referral code, the system places them in the correct position in the referral/binary tree. Placement logic ensures each user is connected to their sponsor and, if using a binary tree, to the left or right position as per business rules. This structure enables tracking of downlines and network growth.
- **Admin Operations:**  
  Admin login, user management, and admin-specific endpoints.
- **Email Notifications:**  
  Sends password reset and other transactional emails.
- **Security:**  
  Uses JWT for authentication, bcrypt for password hashing, and CORS for frontend access.

---

## 🛡️ Middlewares

- **CORS:**  
  Configured to allow requests from the frontend (`CLIENT_URL` or `http://localhost:3000`), with credentials and standard headers.
- **cookieParser:**  
  Parses cookies for JWT and session management.
- **express.json:**  
  Parses incoming JSON requests.
- **jwtAuth:**  
  Protects routes that require authentication by verifying JWT tokens.
- **wrapAsync:**  
  Utility to catch async errors in route handlers and pass them to Express error handling.
- **Error Handler:**  
  Catches all errors and returns a JSON response with error details.

## 🌳 User Placement & Connection Logic

### How User Placement Works

- **Referral Code:**  
  When a new user registers, they provide a referral code. The system validates this code and determines the sponsor.
- **Binary Tree Placement:**  
  The system checks the sponsor's left and right positions. If a position is available, the new user is placed there. If both are filled, placement may follow a spillover or other business logic.
- **User Document Fields:**
  - `sponsorId`: The direct sponsor (referrer).
  - `parentId`: The parent in the binary tree (may be same as sponsor or determined by placement logic).
  - `leftUser` / `rightUser`: References to the user's left and right downlines.
  - `referralCodeLeft` / `referralCodeRight`: Codes for left/right placement.
- **Placement Endpoint:**  
  The `/api/referral/placement` endpoint (or handled during registration) manages this logic, ensuring users are connected correctly in the tree.

### Example Placement Flow

1. **User registers with referral code.**
2. **System validates the code and finds the sponsor.**
3. **System checks sponsor's left/right positions:**
   - If left is empty, user is placed left.
   - If right is empty, user is placed right.
   - If both are filled, system finds next available position (spillover).
4. **User document is updated with sponsor/parent/left/right references.**
5. **Sponsor's user document is updated to reference the new user.**

## 📝 Notes

- All passwords are hashed with bcrypt.
- JWT tokens are set as HTTP-only cookies on login.
- Profile update does not allow changing referral or admin fields.
- All errors are returned as JSON.
- Referral and placement logic supports both direct and binary tree relationships.
- Admin users can be seeded via `seed.js`.
- **User placement logic ensures every new user is connected in the referral/binary tree as per business rules.**

## 🛠️ Service Overview & Integration

### 1. **API Gateway**
- **Role:** Single entry point for all frontend/backend API calls.
- **Routes:** Proxies requests to user, wallet, income, and admin services.
- **Example:** `/api/auth/register` → user-service, `/api/wallet/user/topup-request` → wallet-service.

### 2. **User Service**
- **Role:** Handles user registration, authentication, profile, referral tree, and placement logic.
- **Routes:** `/api/auth/*`, `/api/referral/*`
- **Referral Placement:** On registration, users are placed in a binary tree structure under a sponsor.

### 3. **Wallet Service** (NEW)
- **Role:** Manages user wallets, top-up requests, withdrawal requests, and wallet transactions.
- **Routes:** `/user/topup-request`, `/user/withdraw-request`, `/user/:id/wallet`, `/admin/topup-request/:id/approve`, `/admin/withdraw-request/:id/approve`
- **Integration:** 
  - When a top-up is approved, the wallet is credited and a trigger is sent to the income-service for commission distribution.
  - Withdrawal requests are validated against wallet balance.

### 4. **Income Service** (NEW)
- **Role:** Handles income distribution, commission logic, and business volume calculations.
- **Routes:** `/api/income/topup-trigger`, `/api/income/...`
- **Integration:** Receives triggers from wallet-service after top-up approval and distributes income up the referral tree.

### 5. **Admin Service**
- **Role:** Admin authentication, user management, dashboard stats.
- **Routes:** `/api/admin/*`

---

## 🔗 How Services Work Together

### Example: **Top-up Approval Flow**

1. **User submits a top-up request** via `/api/wallet/user/topup-request` (API Gateway → wallet-service).
2. **Admin approves the top-up** via `/api/wallet/admin/topup-request/:id/approve` (API Gateway → wallet-service).
3. **Wallet-service actions:**
   - Marks the top-up as approved.
   - Credits the user's topupWallet.
   - **Triggers income-service** (`/api/income/topup-trigger`) to distribute commissions.
   - **Optionally notifies user-service** to activate the user if this is their first top-up.
4. **Income-service actions:**
   - Calculates and distributes commissions up the referral tree.
   - Updates business volume and income records.
5. **Frontend** is updated via API Gateway responses.

### Example: **Withdrawal Request Flow**

1. **User submits a withdrawal request** via `/api/wallet/user/withdraw-request`.
2. **Admin approves the withdrawal** via `/api/wallet/admin/withdraw-request/:id/approve`.
3. **Wallet-service** deducts the amount from the user's incomeWallet and marks the request as approved.
